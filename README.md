# Multilevel Characterization of Protein Sequences


In this work Multilevel Protein Prediction Model has been proposed for the category, characteristics, species, and function characterization of protein sequences. Four different level of predictions have been performed in ML_PP model.  Protein sequences have are predicted as Gram-Positive Protein Sequences (G+_PS) and Non-Gram-Positive Protein Sequences (Non_G+_PS) at the first level , for the next levels of prediction G+_PS sequences have been considered and Non_G+_PS sequences are discarded. In the second level G+_PS are characterized as Pathogenic (Path_G+) and Nonpathogenic (Non_Path_G+). Three different species namely Staphylococcus Aureus (Path_G+_SP1), Clostridia (Path_G+_SP2), and Streptococcus Pneumoniae (Path_G+_SP3) of the Path_G+ protein sequences have recogized in the third level of prediction. In the fourth level functions of the three different Path_G+ species are characterized. Performance of the ML_PP model is validated in each level of the prediction through known protein sequences with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Further validated ML_PP model has been utilized for the category, characteristics, species, and functions prediction of unknown protein sequences.

Folder “Model Training and Validation using Known Protein Data” contains the codes and datasets for all levels (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4a, Level 4b, Level 4c) of the prediction for known protein sequences. Folder “Prediction of Unknown Protein Sequences” contains codes and dataset for all levels of the prediction for unknown protein sequence.
