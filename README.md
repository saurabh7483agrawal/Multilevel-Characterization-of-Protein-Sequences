# Multilevel Characterization of Protein Sequences


In this work Multilevel Protein Prediction Model has been proposed for the category, characteristics, species, and function characterization of protein sequences. Four different level of predictions have been performed in ML_PP model.  

Folder “Model Training and Validation using Known Protein Data” contains the codes and datasets for all levels (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4a, Level 4b, Level 4c) of the prediction for known protein sequences. Folder “Prediction of Unknown Protein Sequences” contains codes and dataset for all levels of the prediction for unknown protein sequence.
